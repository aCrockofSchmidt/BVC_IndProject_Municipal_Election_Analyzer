# BVC_IndProject_Municipal_Election_Analyzer
As a student in cohort 6 of the Bow Valley College Tech Skills Initiative, I was part of a team of 15 tasked with completing an "Industry Project" as part of the curriculum. The primary purpose of our Industry Project, was to create a database and dashboard that would enable candidates in the 2021 Calgary Municipal Election to conduct data analysis of the results from the 2017 Calgary Municipal Election. This analyis would revolve around a comparison of election results to community demographics for the various defined communities in the city.

The project was divided into two phases. The first was the creation of the database in SQL Server and the second was the creation of the dashboard in Power BI. The latter task became a practicum for some of the cohort and therefore was not included in the full-cohort Industry Project.

The cohort of 15 students was divided into 4 teams: data cleaning, development, quality assurance, project management. I was part of the data cleaning team and as such was not directly involved in the other teams' work. I found this an unfortunate design as it restricted learning to just one segment of the database creation process. Furthermore, as the project evolved and came to fruition, I was left with many questions about the structure of the database itself.

I decided it was to my own benefit to recreate the Industry Project relational database according to my own understanding of the project and structure decisions. As such, I've relied heavily on the groundwork conducted by the development team. I did not copy their work verbatim, and indeed I've made some significant changes (improvements?). But I'd have spent many a day chasing my tail without the incredible amount of work they did in the first place.

My final product will include both phases of the Industry Project. My SQL Server relational database and a functioning Power BI dashboard to navigate the database.
